    Notes:
        1.
            ‚ùåslither built-in functions, state_variables_read, state_variables_written only detects the requires,
            state variables that directly appear in the function. If they reside within another function call, or
            in a modifier, the built-in functions will not be able to detect them.

            However, IR that is used in this implementation will detect all indirect requires and state variables.

            We have to be very cautious on which approach we should take.

            ‚úî*** Currently, we are computing the "read by require" correctly, because we are using IR to find the require
                statements and taking out all the state variables from it.

            ‚úî*** However, if a state variable is indirectly written, our current implementation will not detect it.
                Switching to IR will help, but at this moment, it may be of lower priority.

            ‚ùå*** Require indirect read of state/local variable is also not supported at the moment.

        2.
            ‚ùå*** Modifiers can modify state variables. While the state variables written by the modifier are loaded in the
            Function object of our design, it is still yet to be determined on what to do with it.

            Modifiers can take input parameters as well.

            Modifiers can call another function within itself....üòí

            Modifier can be used to check both pre-condition or post-condition
            And a single modifier can check both pre-condition and post-condition at the same time....üòí
